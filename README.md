Abstract
Chinese paper-cut art, renowned for its intricate designs and distinctive patterns, embodies the rich cultural heritage of China. Despite its artistic merit, transferring these delicate designs to contemporary products poses significant challenges due to their unique texture and precision. This study introduces a style transfer algorithm based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to adapt paper-cut designs for everyday product use. Leveraging modern technology, our method aims to preserve the visual beauty and traditional essence of paper-cut art while integrating it into contemporary applications. The proposed algorithm utilizes a pre-trained VGG19 network optimized for rapid extraction of style and content features, incorporating total variation loss and an adaptive Adam optimization algorithm to improve image smoothness and mitigate gradient issues. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively transfers paper-cut style to various product designs, enhancing their aesthetic appeal and cultural authenticity.

Transfer using VGG19: https://github.com/GangzhiGuo/my-data-project which employing the VGG19 network for general style transfer tasks. Unlike their work, which used ImageNet for general artistic styles, this study not only contributes to the preservation and modernization of Chinese cultural heritage but also highlights the potential of AI in innovating traditional art forms, thus addressing the challenges of preserving cultural authenticity in modern applications.
